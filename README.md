No copyrighted commercial translations or licensed audio are bundled. The read-aloud control uses the browser/operating system speech service and is labeled as device read-aloud.

## Production architecture notes

This repository is a dependency-free, local-first release. Notes, prayers, highlights, and profile settings remain in `localStorage`; this is explicitly disclosed in the interface. Real cloud authentication, multi-tenant church accounts, payment providers, external generative AI, remote device pairing, and push scheduling require production infrastructure and are not falsely presented as connected.

For production SaaS deployment, add:

- PostgreSQL with row-level tenant authorization
- Server-side email/social authentication and secure HTTP-only sessions
- Object storage with signed URLs
- WebSocket/SSE session tokens for multi-device presentation
- Stripe/Paystack/Flutterwave hosted checkout
- Licensed translation/audio providers
- Queue-backed email and Web Push
- External AI provider behind server-side citation verification, cost controls, and safety policy
- Automated encrypted backups, monitoring, audit logs, and CI/CD environments

Never place provider secrets in browser code. Use the names in `.env.example` on the server only.

## Health check

`GET /health` returns service status without secrets or stack traces.

## Keyboard shortcuts

- `Ctrl/Cmd + K` — command search
- `B` — Bible
- `S` — Search
- `P` — Ministry presentation
